# Dissertation for MPhil in Population Health Sciences (Health Data Science)
The topic of my dissertation is Machine Learning methods for characterising cell-type annotations in single-cell high-throughput datasets.

This study developed a novel cell-type annotation tool by stacking several popular tools and applying voting to determine the final cell-types. It also highlights the necessity of stability assessment of both cells and clustering. 

The attched three R markdown files are code generated in this study. It should be run in a fixed sequence (marked in the file name) and in the same environment, as some variables and packages are generated or loaded in the previous file.
